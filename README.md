# Notes
~~Fix the deleting of completed tasks~~<br><br>
~~Border of the task container is not visible~~ <br> border: 2px solid gray;
<br><br><br><br>
Does something wrong about using useState hook as boolean?<br><br>
How the hRef works, does it combined with useEffect ?<br><br>
What is the current there, is it default ?<br><br>

```
    const toggleCompleted = () => {
        setCompleted(current => !current )
    }
    onClick={toggleCompleted}

```
